        <p>
            A Nexsoul belonging to the Water and Ethereal Orders, Lunirvana
            is one of the final forms that a Nudibun can take. Said to be
            born on the moon, Lunirvana are calm and composed, almost 
            eerily so. While their form may seem to resemble a rabbit, 
            their biology is astoundingly different, lacking fur and bones.
            At this stage in their life cycle, these creatures are ready to
            leave the planet and return to the moon that they once called
            home.
